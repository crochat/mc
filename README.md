# Midnight Commander Enlightment Theme
This is just a 256 color very clean and nice to use Midnight Commander theme I've prepared years ago with Jean-Samuel Christophe.
Just use the files pretty much the way they're placed in the different folders, there's nothing else to say.
Be sure to export 256 color TERM variable in your .bashrc (or just in command line to test), the way it's
explained in home/user/.bashrc file.
